Music needs to be in a folder called "Music"
Jet.png needs to be in a folder called "images"
although map.tmx doesnt work it uses the images provided to create a map via Tiled "https://www.mapeditor.org"
enemy.py is never loaded in the code so it only works in theory
and the bullets dont work properly for whatever reason
controller only right trigger can be used

not great.
